$1000,bicycle type: cyclocross brake type: v-brakes condition: like new frame size: 60 cm handlebar type: drop make / manufacturer: Ridley model name / number: XBow suspension: none (rigid) wheel size: 700C,"European style cyclocross bike. This bike rides very nicely off-road. It is very smooth and predictable.

 The bike is fitted with good Shimano components. Not the lower end stuff. The cranks are SRAM. The V-brakes are TRP 9.0 - the best money can buy and almost as good as hydraulic disks but more predictable. Mavic wheels that do not have a weight limit as many of today's wheels do.

 32 mm street tires are fitted since riding gravel on knobbies isn't necessary and hard pack or asphalt between other paths is better on the street tires. If you like I can include a set of 32 mm knobbies.

 It would also make a very good commuter though I sure as hell wouldn't park it outside. For the quality of the bike and its components this is an absolute steal of a price.
