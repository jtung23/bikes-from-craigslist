    badPostBody: 'Like new Specialized Sirrus Expert bike for sale! Designed as a cyclo-cross bike it\'s light weight (19lbs), has the handlebars of a mountain bike and the slicks (tires) of a road bike. It rides great on the street and light terrain. Sadly I rarely used it and it hung on my bike rack for years!\n 17" (43cm) frame, 21 speed, shimano gearing, shimano clip-ins, aluminum frame, carbon forks, with Sella Italia seat (for ladies)--the most comfortable seat I\'ve even owned.\n\n Thanks for looking!',
